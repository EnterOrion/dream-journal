# Dream Journal

## About

This is a simple web application made with React and SASS to record dreams. <br/>
It also contains a basic analysis of your dreams to find reoccurring dream signs. The app will ask you what you dreamed of last night once per day, and then it will display all your recorded dreams. From there, you can click "analyze" to find patterns in your dreams. You may also delete entries if you don't want them kept anymore.
<br />
The app utilizes local storage so that the dreams are kept even after refreshing or closing the window.
